# 📺 C++ Object-Oriented Programming – Practice Projects

This repository contains **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice programs** built around a **YouTube channel simulation** concept.

⚠️ **Note:**
A **separate and more complete YouTube Management System** exists in this repository.
The files in this folder are **learning-focused examples**, created to understand OOP fundamentals step by step.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of These Files

These programs are designed to:

* Practice **C++ OOP concepts**
* Understand how real-world systems are modeled in code
* Build a strong foundation before moving to a full management system

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

* Classes & Objects
* Public vs Private access specifiers
* Constructors
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* STL `list` container
* Basic input/output

---

## 📁 Files Included

### 1️⃣ Basic Class & Object Example

📌 **Description:**
Demonstrates a simple class with **public members** and object creation.

📌 **Focus:**

* Understanding how objects store and access data
* Introduction to STL containers

---

### 2️⃣ Encapsulation-Based YouTube Channel

📌 **Description:**
Improves the basic model by introducing **private data members** and **member functions**.

📌 **Focus:**

* Data hiding
* Controlled access to subscribers and videos
* Constructor usage

---

### 3️⃣ Inheritance Example (Gaming Channel)

📌 **Description:**
Extends the base YouTube class to create a **gaming-specific channel**.

📌 **Focus:**

* Inheritance
* Code reusability
* Extending base class functionality

---

## 🛠 Compilation & Execution

Use **g++** to compile any file:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o app
./app
```

---

## 🚀 Main Project

👉 **YouTube Management System**
A separate file/project in this repository contains a **more complete and structured YouTube Management System**, which applies these OOP concepts in a practical way.
